# Linux Services: Overview and Management

Linux services are processes that run in the background and provide specific functionality to the system or to users. They typically start automatically at boot time and continue running until the system is shut down, handling tasks like networking, logging, printing, and more.

## Service Management Systems

Linux distributions primarily use one of three service management systems:

| System | Used In | Key Commands |
|--------|---------|------------|
| systemd | Ubuntu (16.04+), Debian (8+), RHEL/CentOS (7+), Fedora | `systemctl` |
| SysVinit | Older distributions, some specialized systems | `service`, `chkconfig` |
| Upstart | Ubuntu (9.10 to 15.04) | `initctl`, `start`, `stop` |

This documentation focuses primarily on systemd, the most widely used service manager in modern Linux distributions.

## systemd Architecture

systemd is not a single daemon but a collection of programs, daemons, libraries, technologies, and kernel components. Unlike traditional init systems, systemd aims to standardize service management and extends much deeper into system operations.

Key characteristics of systemd:

- Provides parallel startup of services
- Manages dependencies between services
- Implements socket and D-Bus activation
- Offers on-demand starting of services
- Tracks processes using Linux control groups
- Maintains system state in dynamically managed directories

## Understanding systemd Units

In systemd, all managed entities are known as "units." Units are categorized by type, with `.service` files defining services.

### Common Unit Types

| Unit Type | File Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Service | `.service` | System services |
| Socket | `.socket` | IPC socket for service activation |
| Target | `.target` | Group of units (similar to runlevels) |
| Timer | `.timer` | Scheduled activation of units |
| Mount | `.mount` | Filesystem mount points |
| Device | `.device` | Kernel device units |

### Unit File Locations

systemd unit files are stored in several directories:
- `/lib/systemd/system/`: Units provided by installed packages
- `/etc/systemd/system/`: Units created by the system administrator
- `/run/systemd/system/`: Runtime units

## Basic Service Management Commands

### Viewing Services

```bash
# List all active services
systemctl list-units --type=service

# List all services, including inactive
systemctl list-units --type=service --all

# View detailed information about a specific service
systemctl status nginx.service
```

### Controlling Services

```bash
# Start a service
sudo systemctl start nginx.service

# Stop a service
sudo systemctl stop nginx.service

# Restart a service
sudo systemctl restart nginx.service

# Reload a service's configuration without restarting
sudo systemctl reload nginx.service

# Check if a service is active
systemctl is-active nginx.service
```

### Managing Service Startup

```bash
# Enable a service to start at boot
sudo systemctl enable nginx.service

# Disable a service from starting at boot
sudo systemctl disable nginx.service

# Check if a service is enabled
systemctl is-enabled nginx.service

# Enable and immediately start a service
sudo systemctl enable --now nginx.service
```

## Creating a Custom Service

You can create your own systemd service by defining a unit file:

### Example: Simple Web Server Service

1. Create a service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mywebapp.service
```

2. Add the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My Custom Web Application
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=webuser
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/myapp
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 app.py
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Reload systemd to recognize the new service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

4. Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now mywebapp.service
```

## Understanding Service Files

A service file consists of three main sections:

### [Unit] Section

Contains metadata and dependencies:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Nginx Web Server
Documentation=https://nginx.org/en/docs/
After=network.target network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target
```

Common options:
- `Description`: Human-readable description
- `Documentation`: URLs to documentation
- `After`: Units that must start before this one
- `Requires`: Hard dependencies
- `Wants`: Soft dependencies

### [Service] Section

Defines how the service runs:

```ini
[Service]
Type=forking
PIDFile=/run/nginx.pid
ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/nginx -t -q -g 'daemon on;'
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx -g 'daemon on;'
ExecReload=/usr/sbin/nginx -g 'daemon on;' -s reload
ExecStop=/bin/kill -s QUIT $MAINPID
TimeoutStopSec=5
KillMode=mixed
```

Common options:
- `Type`: How systemd treats the process (simple, forking, oneshot, etc.)
- `ExecStart`: Command to start the service
- `ExecStop`: Command to stop the service
- `Restart`: When to restart (always, on-failure, on-abort, etc.)
- `User`/`Group`: User/group to run the service as
- `Environment`: Environment variables

### [Install] Section

Defines how and when the service is enabled:

```ini
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Common options:
- `WantedBy`: Target that wants this service when enabled
- `RequiredBy`: Target that requires this service when enabled
- `Alias`: Alternative names for the unit

## Understanding Unit Statuses

When managing services with systemd, you'll encounter different unit statuses that indicate the current state of a service. Understanding these statuses is essential for proper troubleshooting.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| `loaded` | Unit file has been processed |
| `active` | Running successfully |
| `inactive` | Not running but configured properly |
| `enabled` | Set to start at boot |
| `disabled` | Not set to start at boot |
| `failed` | The unit has failed in some way |
| `masked` | Administratively blocked from being started |
| `static` | Cannot be enabled, but may be started by another unit |

These statuses can be checked using the `systemctl status` command:

```bash
systemctl status nginx.service
```

Example output:
```
● nginx.service - NGINX Web Server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Sat 2023-01-01 12:00:00 UTC; 3h ago
     Docs: https://nginx.org/en/docs/
  Process: 1234 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service
           ├─1234 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx
           └─1235 nginx: worker process
```

The `enabled` and `disabled` states apply only to unit files with an `[Install]` section. When enabled, the unit will start automatically at boot according to its target dependencies.

## Service Types

The `Type=` setting in the `[Service]` section affects how systemd manages the service:

| Type | Description | Example Use Case |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `simple` | Main process is executed directly | Single-process applications |
| `forking` | Process forks, parent exits | Traditional daemons |
| `oneshot` | Process runs once and exits | Quick configuration tasks |
| `notify` | Process signals when ready | Services with readiness notification |
| `idle` | Process starts after other jobs finish | Low-priority background services |
| `exec` | Like simple but waits for exec() | Applications with complex startup |

## Managing Service Logs

systemd includes a unified logging system called `journald`:

```bash
# View logs for a specific service
journalctl -u nginx.service

# View logs for a service since boot
journalctl -u nginx.service -b

# Follow logs in real-time (like tail -f)
journalctl -u nginx.service -f

# View logs within a time range
journalctl -u nginx.service --since "2023-01-01" --until "2023-01-02"
```

## Analyzing Service Dependencies

```bash
# List dependencies of a service
systemctl list-dependencies nginx.service

# List services that depend on a service
systemctl list-dependencies --reverse nginx.service
```

## Managing Services with Socket Activation

Socket activation allows systemd to create the listening socket but only start the service when a connection arrives:

```bash
# Create a socket unit file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/myapp.socket
```

Example socket file:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My Application Socket

[Socket]
ListenStream=8080
Accept=no

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
```

Then create the corresponding service file:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My Application
Requires=myapp.socket

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/myapp
StandardInput=socket
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Managing Service Resource Limits

systemd allows setting resource limits for services:

```ini
[Service]
# Limit CPU and memory
CPUQuota=30%
MemoryLimit=512M

# Limit disk I/O
IOWeight=500
IODeviceWeight=/dev/sda 1000

# Other limits
LimitNOFILE=16384
LimitNPROC=4096
```

## SysVinit Commands (for older systems)

If you're working on an older Linux system that uses SysVinit:

```bash
# Start a service
sudo service nginx start

# Stop a service
sudo service nginx stop

# Restart a service
sudo service nginx restart

# Check service status
sudo service nginx status

# Enable a service to start at boot
sudo chkconfig nginx on

# Disable a service from starting at boot
sudo chkconfig nginx off
```

## Upstart Commands (for Ubuntu 9.10-15.04)

If you're working on an Ubuntu system from 9.10 to 15.04:

```bash
# Start a service
sudo start nginx

# Stop a service
sudo stop nginx

# Restart a service
sudo restart nginx

# Check service status
sudo status nginx
```

## Converting Between Service Systems

### SysVinit to systemd

If you need to convert an old SysVinit script to a systemd service:

```bash
# Use the systemd-sysv-generator tool
systemd-sysv-generator

# Manual conversion example
# Original: /etc/init.d/myservice
# Converted: /etc/systemd/system/myservice.service

[Unit]
Description=My Legacy Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/etc/init.d/myservice start
ExecStop=/etc/init.d/myservice stop
PIDFile=/var/run/myservice.pid

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Troubleshooting Services

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Service fails to start:**

   Check logs for error messages:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u myservice.service -b
   ```

2. **Service starts but exits immediately:**

   Check for configuration errors or missing dependencies:
   ```bash
   systemctl status myservice.service
   ```

3. **Service won't enable at boot:**

   Verify the [Install] section has the correct target:
   ```bash
   systemctl cat myservice.service | grep WantedBy
   ```

4. **Service dependencies not loading:**

   Check and fix the dependency chain:
   ```bash
   systemctl list-dependencies myservice.service
   ```

### Debug Techniques

```bash
# Run a service in debug mode (if supported)
sudo systemctl start myservice.service --log-level=debug

# Run service executable manually to check for errors
sudo -u serviceuser /path/to/executable --options

# Check for permission issues
ls -la /path/to/service/directory
```

## Best Practices

1. **Security Hardening:**
   ```ini
   [Service]
   # Run as non-root user
   User=appuser
   Group=appgroup
   
   # Restrict capabilities
   CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
   
   # Restrict file system
   ProtectSystem=strict
   ProtectHome=true
   PrivateTmp=true
   ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/myapp
   ```

2. **Restart Policies:**
   ```ini
   [Service]
   # Automatically restart on failure
   Restart=on-failure
   # Wait 10 seconds before restart
   RestartSec=10
   # Maximum 5 restarts in 30 seconds
   StartLimitInterval=30
   StartLimitBurst=5
   ```

3. **Dependency Management:**
   Use `Wants=` instead of `Requires=` for soft dependencies to prevent cascading failures.

## Hands-on Lab Exercises

These practical exercises will help you gain experience with Linux service management. Each exercise builds upon knowledge from the previous ones.

### Exercise 1: Exploring Existing Services

**Objective:** Become familiar with listing and examining service information

1. List all currently active services:
   ```bash
   systemctl list-units --type=service
   ```

2. Find specific information about the SSH service:
   ```bash
   systemctl status sshd.service
   ```

3. Check if the web server (Apache or Nginx) is installed and running:
   ```bash
   systemctl status apache2.service
   # or
   systemctl status nginx.service
   ```

4. List all services that start at boot:
   ```bash
   systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled
   ```

5. Examine the logs for a specific service (e.g., SSH):
   ```bash
   journalctl -u sshd.service -n 20
   ```

### Exercise 2: Controlling System Services

**Objective:** Practice starting, stopping, and restarting services

1. If Apache or Nginx is installed, stop the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop apache2.service  # or nginx.service
   ```

2. Verify the service has stopped:
   ```bash
   systemctl is-active apache2.service
   ```

3. Start the service again:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start apache2.service
   ```

4. Reload the service configuration without full restart:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload apache2.service
   ```

5. Restart the service completely:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
   ```

### Exercise 3: Creating a Custom Service

**Objective:** Create, configure and manage your own systemd service

1. Create a simple Python web server script:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/myserver
   cd ~/myserver
   
   # Create a simple Python HTTP server script
   cat > server.py << 'EOF'
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   from http.server import HTTPServer, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
   import os
   
   # Change to the script directory
   os.chdir(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
   
   # Create sample index.html
   with open('index.html', 'w') as f:
       f.write('<html><body><h1>My Custom Service is Running!</h1></body></html>')
   
   # Run server
   server = HTTPServer(('localhost', 8000), SimpleHTTPRequestHandler)
   print('Starting server at http://localhost:8000')
   server.serve_forever()
   EOF
   
   # Make the script executable
   chmod +x server.py
   
   # Test run it (press Ctrl+C to stop after confirming it works)
   ./server.py
   ```

2. Create a systemd service file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mywebserver.service
   ```

3. Create a setup script that will run before the service starts:
   ```bash
   cat > ~/myserver/setup.sh << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "[$(date)] Pre-start setup running..." > /tmp/mywebserver_pre.log
   echo "Checking for required directory structure..." >> /tmp/mywebserver_pre.log
   mkdir -p ~/myserver/logs
   echo "Pre-start setup complete." >> /tmp/mywebserver_pre.log
   EOF
   
   chmod +x ~/myserver/setup.sh
   ```

4. Create a post-start notification script:
   ```bash
   cat > ~/myserver/post-start.sh << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "[$(date)] Post-start actions running..." > /tmp/mywebserver_post.log
   echo "Service should now be available at http://localhost:8000" >> /tmp/mywebserver_post.log
   # Could send notification, update status file, etc.
   echo "Post-start actions complete." >> /tmp/mywebserver_post.log
   EOF
   
   chmod +x ~/myserver/post-start.sh
   ```

5. Add the following content to the service file with ExecStartPre and ExecStartPost:
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=My Python Web Server
   After=network.target
   
   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=$USER
   WorkingDirectory=/home/$USER/myserver
   
   # Run setup script before starting the service
   ExecStartPre=/home/$USER/myserver/setup.sh
   
   # Main service
   ExecStart=/home/$USER/myserver/server.py
   
   # Run notification script after service starts
   ExecStartPost=/home/$USER/myserver/post-start.sh
   
   Restart=on-failure
   
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

6. Reload systemd to recognize the new service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

7. Start your custom service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mywebserver.service
   ```

8. Check the status of your service:
   ```bash
   systemctl status mywebserver.service
   ```

9. Test your web server using curl or a web browser:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000
   ```

10. Check the pre-start and post-start logs:
    ```bash
    cat /tmp/mywebserver_pre.log
    cat /tmp/mywebserver_post.log
    ```

11. View the service logs:
    ```bash
    journalctl -u mywebserver.service
    ```

12. Enable your service to start at boot:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable mywebserver.service
    ```

### Exercise 4: Modifying and Troubleshooting Services

**Objective:** Practice modifying service behavior and troubleshooting

1. Modify your web server service to run on a different port:
   ```bash
   # Edit the Python file
   nano ~/myserver/server.py
   ```
   Change the port from `8000` to `8080` in the HTTPServer line.

2. Restart your service to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart mywebserver.service
   ```

3. Intentionally introduce an error by modifying the service file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mywebserver.service
   ```
   Change `ExecStart=/home/$USER/myserver/server.py` to `ExecStart=/home/$USER/myserver/server_typo.py`

4. Reload systemd and try to start the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart mywebserver.service
   ```

5. Check the status and logs to identify the problem:
   ```bash
   systemctl status mywebserver.service
   journalctl -u mywebserver.service -n 20
   ```

6. Fix the error and restart the service:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mywebserver.service
   # Correct the typo in ExecStart
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart mywebserver.service
   ```

### Exercise 5: Advanced Service Configuration

**Objective:** Experiment with advanced service features

1. Add memory and CPU limits to your service:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mywebserver.service
   ```
   
   Add the following lines to the [Service] section:
   ```ini
   # Resource limits
   MemoryLimit=100M
   CPUQuota=20%
   ```

2. Configure environment variables for your service:
   Add to the [Service] section:
   ```ini
   Environment="PORT=8000" "DEBUG=true"
   ```

3. Create an override configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl edit mywebserver.service
   ```
   
   This will open a new file. Add:
   ```ini
   [Service]
   # Override restart settings
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=5
   ```

4. Reload and restart to apply all changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart mywebserver.service
   ```

5. Clean up after completing exercises:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop mywebserver.service
   sudo systemctl disable mywebserver.service
   sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/mywebserver.service
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

## Summary

Managing Linux services is primarily done through systemd in modern distributions. The systemctl command provides a unified interface for starting, stopping, enabling, and monitoring services. Custom services can be created by defining unit files in the /etc/systemd/system/ directory.

Understanding service management is essential for Linux system administration, allowing for proper control of background processes, application deployment, and system monitoring.

## Understanding systemd Targets

In systemd, targets are units that group other units together and provide synchronization points during boot. They replace traditional SysVinit runlevels with a more flexible mechanism.

### Common Targets

| Target | Description | SysVinit Equivalent |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| `poweroff.target` | System shutdown | Runlevel 0 |
| `rescue.target` | Single-user mode | Runlevel 1 |
| `multi-user.target` | Multi-user, non-graphical | Runlevel 3 |
| `graphical.target` | Multi-user, graphical | Runlevel 5 |
| `reboot.target` | System reboot | Runlevel 6 |
| `emergency.target` | Emergency shell | - |

### Managing Targets

```bash
# View current target
systemctl get-default

# Change default target
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target

# Switch to a target immediately
sudo systemctl isolate rescue.target

# List available targets
systemctl list-units --type=target
```

The `isolate` command is particularly important - it activates the specified target and its dependencies while deactivating all other units.

## Service Customization and Overrides

One of systemd's powerful features is the ability to customize existing services without modifying the original unit files.

### Creating Override Files

Instead of editing vendor-provided unit files (which may be overwritten during updates), you can create overrides:

```bash
# Create override directory and file
sudo systemctl edit nginx.service
```

This command creates a directory at `/etc/systemd/system/nginx.service.d/` and opens an editor for the file `override.conf`. Any settings you add will override the original unit file settings.

Example override to change the timeout and add memory limits:

```ini
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=30s
MemoryLimit=512M
```

After creating or modifying an override file, reload systemd:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
```

### Viewing Combined Configuration

To see the effective configuration after all overrides are applied:

```bash
systemctl cat nginx.service
```

### Masking Services

To completely prevent a service from being started (even manually):

```bash
sudo systemctl mask bluetooth.service
```

This creates a symlink from the service file to `/dev/null`, making it impossible to start. To unmask:

```bash
sudo systemctl unmask bluetooth.service
```
