## What is Telos?

**Telos** (from the Greek word for "purpose") is a framework developed by Daniel Miessler for achieving clarity and purpose in an age of rapid technological change. At its core, Telos is about answering the fundamental question: **"What are you about?"**

### The Core Concept

A **Telos File** is a single Markdown document that serves as your personal operating manual. It captures your purpose, challenges, history, and goals in a structured way that provides two superpowers:

1. **Self-Clarity**: Forces brutal honesty about who you are, what you care about, and where you're going
2. **AI Context**: Gives any AI system deep, rich context about you, enabling it to help you problem-solve, identify blind spots, and act as an accountability partner

### The Philosophy

The Telos Method is built on several key insights:

- **Human value is shifting from task execution to problem definition**
- **AI anxiety stems from not knowing your unique human value**
- **The future economy will reward those who can define problems, not just solve them**
- **Your lived experience is your unfair advantage against AI**

---

## Why Telos Matters in the AI Era

### The Automation Reality

The ideal number of employees for most companies in the future is approaching zero. AI agents will soon be capable of performing most tasks currently done by humans. This creates both a threat and an opportunity:

**Threat**: Without a clear Telos, you become vulnerable to automation and irrelevance.

**Opportunity**: With a clear Telos, you can leverage AI to handle execution while you focus on strategy and meaning-making.

### The Value Shift

We're transitioning from:
- **Task-doers** → **Goal-definers**
- **How-focused** → **Why-focused**
- **Resume-driven** → **Narrative-driven**
- **Hours logged** → **Outcomes achieved**

### Career Security in the AI Age

Career security no longer comes from technical skills alone. It comes from:
1. **Understanding your unique human value proposition**
2. **Defining problems rather than solving predefined ones**
3. **Connecting disparate ideas in novel ways**
4. **Providing meaning and direction**

---

## Getting Started with Telos

### Materials Needed

- A text editor (VS Code, Obsidian, Notepad, or any notes app)
- A Markdown file (e.g., `my_telos.md`)
- 7-10 minutes of focused time
- (Optional) A cup of coffee or tea

### The Mindset

Before you begin, adopt these principles:

- **Be brutally honest** - This document is for you, not for impressing others
- **Embrace vulnerability** - Your insecurities and challenges are as important as your strengths
- **Think in systems** - Connect your past, present, and future into a coherent narrative
- **Start simple** - Don't get bogged down in perfection

---

## Creating Your Telos File

### Step 1: Set Up Your Document

Create a new file called `telos.md`. At the top, write:

```markdown
# My Telos File
Created: [Current Date]
Last Updated: [Current Date]
```

### Step 2: The Core Four Sections

These are the essential pillars. Write quickly and honestly.

#### **1. Problems**

These are the things you see as wrong in the world that you want to solve.

**Ask Yourself:**
- "What frustrates me daily?"
- "What seems broken or unfair?"
- "Does this problem affect others?"

**Example Structure:**
```markdown
## Problems

### Personal Problems
- I need a job in tech but lack the experience everyone requires
- I struggle with maintaining consistent study habits

### Scaled Problems  
- The paradox of needing experience to get a job is a barrier for countless entry-level candidates
- Traditional education doesn't prepare people for real-world technical challenges
```

#### **2. Missions**

These are the things you **will do** about the problems you've identified.

**Use the "Most Important Sentence" Trick:**
"I think one of the biggest problems in the world is **[Problem]**, which is why I'm **[Mission]**."

**Example:**
```markdown
## Missions

- Land my first tech role and later help others break into the industry by demystifying experience requirements
- Create practical educational content that bridges the gap between academic knowledge and industry needs
```

#### **3. Narratives**

This is your elevator pitch. The story of "what you're about" in 8, 15, or 30 seconds.

**Ask Yourself:**
"If an alien with a clipboard asked 'Who are you and what are you here to do?' what would I say?"

**Example:**
```markdown
## Narratives

I'm transitioning from retail into cybersecurity because I'm tired of seeing people get scammed online. I'm building the skills to protect individuals and small businesses from digital threats, and I want to make cybersecurity accessible to people from non-technical backgrounds.
```

#### **4. Goals**

These are the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) actions that make your mission happen.

**Example:**
```markdown
## Goals

### Short-term (Next 3 months)
- Complete the CompTIA Security+ certification by [Date]
- Build one practical home lab project and document it on GitHub each month
- Network with 3 professionals in cybersecurity this quarter

### Medium-term (6-12 months)
- Obtain an entry-level cybersecurity position
- Start a blog or YouTube channel documenting my learning journey
- Mentor 2-3 people trying to break into the field
```

### Step 3: Deeper Context Sections

Once the core is complete, add these sections for richer context:

#### **History**
Key life events that shaped you. This reflection reveals patterns.

```markdown
## History

- Failed third grade twice, which ingrained a fear of failure I'm now overcoming
- Worked in retail for 5 years, developing customer service and problem-solving skills
- Self-taught programming basics during the pandemic, discovering my passion for tech
```

#### **Challenges**
Current obstacles. Brutal honesty here is key.

```markdown
## Challenges

- Lack a consistent study routine due to irregular work schedule
- No direct industry contacts or mentors in cybersecurity
- Limited financial resources for training and certifications
- Imposter syndrome when comparing myself to others with formal CS degrees
```

#### **Insecurities**
What holds you back. Naming them reduces their power.

```markdown
## Insecurities

- Afraid of public speaking and presenting to technical audiences
- My age (35) makes me feel behind in starting a tech career
- Concern that my non-traditional background won't be taken seriously
- Height/appearance impacts my confidence in professional settings
```

#### **Strategies**
How you'll overcome challenges.

```markdown
## Strategies

- Use a website blocker from 7-9 PM for focused study time
- Attend one Toastmasters session per month to improve public speaking
- Join online communities and actively participate to build network
- Focus on project-based learning to demonstrate skills rather than credentials
```

### Step 4: The Journal/Log

This is the most valuable long-term section. Add it at the bottom and maintain it regularly.

```markdown
## Journal

- **[2024-05-17 10:00 PM]:** Felt overwhelmed by job search. Avoided studying and played video games. Noticing this pattern.
- **[2024-05-18 2:00 PM]:** Had great conversation with cybersecurity professional on LinkedIn. Feeling more hopeful.
- **[2024-05-19 8:00 AM]:** Completed first module of Security+ study material. Progress feels good.
```

```bash
# Install Fabric (if not already installed)
pip install fabric-patterns

# Set up your API keys
fabric --setup
```

### Using Fabric with Your Telos File

#### 1. Red Team Analysis
Challenge your assumptions and find blind spots:

```bash
cat personal_telos.md | fabric -l -p red_team_thinking
```

#### 2. Generate Opening Sentences
Create compelling narratives from your Telos:

```bash
cat personal_telos.md | fabric -l -p t_create_opening_sentences
```

#### 3. Find Blind Spots
Identify areas you might be missing:

```bash
cat personal_telos.md | fabric -l -p find_blindspots
```

#### 4. AI-Powered Telos Generation
Use Fabric to help generate your initial Telos:

```bash
# Generate a Telos based on your current situation
echo "I'm a 35-year-old retail worker trying to break into cybersecurity. I'm self-taught and feeling overwhelmed." | fabric -l -p create_telos
```

### Using Fabric with Work Telos and Project Requirements

Here's how to combine your work Telos with specific project requirements for contextual AI assistance:
