# OpenID Connect Deep Dive

## Introduction to OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. While OAuth 2.0 is designed for authorization (granting access to resources), OIDC extends it to provide authentication (verifying user identity). OIDC was developed to address the need for a standardized, secure way to verify user identities across different applications and domains.

## Core Components of OIDC

### 1. Participants in the OIDC Flow

- **End User**: The person who wants to authenticate
- **Relying Party (RP)**: The application that needs to verify the user's identity
- **OpenID Provider (OP)**: The identity provider that authenticates the user and provides claims

### 2. Key Endpoints

- **Authorization Endpoint**: Where the user is redirected to authenticate
- **Token Endpoint**: Where the client exchanges codes for tokens
- **UserInfo Endpoint**: Where the client can get additional user information
- **JWKS Endpoint**: Provides the public keys needed to verify token signatures
- **Discovery Endpoint**: Provides configuration information about the OpenID Provider

### 3. Token Types

- **ID Token**: Contains claims about the authentication of the end user
- **Access Token**: Grants access to protected resources (UserInfo Endpoint)
- **Refresh Token**: Used to obtain new ID and access tokens when they expire

## OIDC Flows

OIDC defines several authentication flows to accommodate different client types:

### 1. Authorization Code Flow

The most common and secure flow, suitable for server-side applications:

1. User attempts to access the application
2. Application redirects to the OpenID Provider's authorization endpoint
3. User authenticates and authorizes the application
4. OpenID Provider redirects back to the application with an authorization code
5. Application exchanges the code for ID and access tokens
6. Application validates the ID token and creates a session

### 2. Implicit Flow

Designed for browser-based applications that cannot securely store secrets:

1. User is redirected to the OpenID Provider
2. User authenticates
3. OpenID Provider redirects back with tokens directly in the URL fragment
4. Application validates the ID token and creates a session

**Note**: This flow is now considered less secure and has been largely superseded by the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE.

### 3. Hybrid Flow

Combines aspects of both Authorization Code and Implicit flows:

1. User is redirected to the OpenID Provider
2. User authenticates
3. OpenID Provider returns some tokens immediately and an authorization code
4. Application exchanges the code for additional tokens

### 4. Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

Enhanced security for public clients like mobile apps and SPAs:

1. Application generates a code verifier and code challenge
2. Application redirects the user to the OpenID Provider with the code challenge
3. User authenticates
4. OpenID Provider redirects back with an authorization code
5. Application exchanges the code and code verifier for tokens
6. Application validates the ID token and creates a session

## ID Tokens in Detail

The ID Token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing claims about the authentication event and the user. A typical ID token payload looks like:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://dex.example.com",      // Issuer - who issued the token
  "sub": "123456789",                    // Subject - unique user identifier
  "aud": "client_id",                    // Audience - intended recipient
  "exp": 1516239022,                     // Expiration time
  "iat": 1516235422,                     // Issued at time
  "auth_time": 1516235421,               // Time of authentication
  "nonce": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",              // Request nonce for replay protection
  "name": "John Doe",                    // User's full name
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",        // User's email
  "email_verified": true                 // Whether email has been verified
}
```

### ID Token Validation

The client must validate the ID token to ensure it's legitimate:

1. Verify the signature using the OpenID Provider's public key
2. Verify the issuer (iss) matches the expected issuer
3. Verify the audience (aud) includes the client ID
4. Check that the token hasn't expired (exp)
5. Verify the nonce if one was sent in the authentication request

## Scopes and Claims in OIDC

OIDC defines standard scopes that map to sets of claims:

- **openid**: Required scope for OIDC. Provides the sub (subject) claim.
- **profile**: User's basic profile information (name, picture, etc.)
- **email**: User's email address and verification status
- **address**: User's physical address
- **phone**: User's phone number and verification status

## OIDC Session Management

OIDC includes mechanisms for managing sessions and performing logout:

### 1. Client-initiated Logout

The client can direct the user to the OpenID Provider's end_session_endpoint to terminate the session.

### 2. RP-initiated Logout

When the user logs out of one application, they can be logged out of all applications connected to the same OpenID Provider.

### 3. Session Monitoring

Applications can monitor the user's session status at the OpenID Provider using techniques like:

- Hidden iframes to the check_session_endpoint
- Periodic checking of ID token validity

## Security Considerations

### 1. Token Storage

- Never store tokens in local storage or session storage (vulnerable to XSS)
- Use httpOnly, secure cookies for server-rendered applications
- Consider using in-memory storage for single-page applications

### 2. Token Validation

- Always validate ID tokens before trusting them
- Verify signatures using the appropriate algorithms and keys
- Check all required claims

### 3. Transport Security

- Always use HTTPS for all OIDC-related communications
- Protect redirect URIs from tampering
- Implement proper CSRF protection

## Advanced OIDC Features

### 1. Claims Requesting

Clients can request specific claims using the claims parameter:

```json
{
  "id_token": {
    "email": {"essential": true},
    "phone_number": null
  },
  "userinfo": {
    "given_name": {"essential": true},
    "family_name": {"essential": true}
  }
}
```

### 2. Request Objects

Complex authentication requests can be packaged as signed JWTs:

```
https://server.example.com/authorize?
  response_type=code
  &client_id=client%5Fid
  &request=eyJhbG...
```

### 3. Pairwise Identifiers

OpenID Providers can use different subject identifiers for the same user across different clients, enhancing privacy.
